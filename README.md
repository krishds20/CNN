# 🏥 Personalized Drug Side-Effect Prediction using CNN

## 📌 Overview
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) pose a significant risk in healthcare, often leading to severe health complications. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance the accuracy of drug side-effect prediction by incorporating personalized patient data such as medical history, age, and other relevant factors. The goal is to help healthcare professionals optimize prescriptions and improve patient safety.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Deep Feature Extraction – CNNs analyze complex medical data patterns.
- ✅ Personalized Predictions – Considers individual patient history for better accuracy.
- ✅ Improved Drug Safety – Helps doctors anticipate ADRs more effectively.
- ✅ Optimized Treatment Decisions – Reduces risks and enhances patient care.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, medical history, etc.).
- Prescribed drug information.
- Reported side effects.
- Other relevant health parameters.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring medical records.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting key attributes from patient history and prescriptions.
3. CNN Model Training: Leveraging deep learning techniques to predict potential ADRs.
4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
